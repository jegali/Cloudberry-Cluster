# NGinx as reverse proxy
If individual servers such as a GIT, blog, WIKI and a CMS-managed web server based on Docker are running on the same or multiple host servers in a closed network, these services can be made externally accessible via a reverse proxy and then all accessed from the outside under port 80 and 443. A separate URL for each individual service then forwards the request to the correct server.

Of course, we will also look at an application example under Docker - but first, the website "mallowz" is to be hosted on one of the Raspberrys. The use case is as follows: A user in the internet types in http://aurorafox.de in his browser. The URL aurorafox.de is resolved by strato's DNS to my HP slice and will be served from the HP slice at 192.168.178.29. If the user types in http://aurorafox.de/mallowz in his browser, the URL is resolved by strao's DNS to my HP slice again, and then the NGinx will redirect /mallowz/ to the server http://192.168.178.101 which serves the mallowz website.
