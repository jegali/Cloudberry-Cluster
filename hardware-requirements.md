## Hardware Requirements
I wanted to make the work for this project as pleasant as possible. In particular, I wanted to have a way to shut down the cluster for vacation periods and be able to restart it just as conveniently. The whole thing should be possible without having to log in to each Raspberry every time and manually shutting down the Raspberry. Because as we all know - simply cutting the power and stopping the Raspberry in this way can corrupt the SD card and thus severely affect the further functioning of the Raspberry.<br/><br/>
Neither did I want eight small power supplies in my room in a multiple socket. So I decided to equip the Raspberry with a Power over Ethernet (PoE) Hat to be able to guarantee the power supply via a switch. As far as both the PoE hats and the switch were concerned, it took several iterations before I was satisfied with the result.
