# Cloudberry-Cluster
In this repository, I show how I built my raspberry Kubernetes cluster - including a small hardware project that deals with creating a front panel with LED and on/off switches so that the cluster can be conveniently started and shut down. I have divided the document into several parts in order to keep it clear and to be able to offer the reader targeted sections in which he is interested.<br/><br/>


## Hardware Requirements

In this section, you'll learn about the hardware requirements that came up for the project. In particular, I want to write about the stumbling blocks in hardware selection, since this was associated with avoidable costs for me - and you don't have to make these mistakes over and over again, do you?

## Architecture and Infrastructure

This section shows the hardware architecture. Closely related to the actual physical structure is the cluster architecture, which I will also present in this section.

## Raspberry Installation
I equipped each Raspberry with a 128GB SD card to be ready for the future. However, the disadvantage of a card of this size is also obvious - if the card is to be cloned, it just takes a little longer. In my case, it took about 1 hour to read the card, and then about 40 minutes to flash each additional instance. With eight cards, it can take a day.
By and large, I followed this website for the basic installation:

![Ubuntu Install](/images/ubuntu-1.png)

https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-desktop-on-raspberry-pi-4#1-overview

The website does a good job, including introducing Raspberry's imaging tool, which should definitely be used. The trick with the SSH file unfortunately did not work for me, but it may also be that this approach does not work under ubuntu in general, since the OpenSSH server still needs to be post-installed.

The guided installation should be carried out in any case to the end - because here you can directly assign a user account and password, make country-specific settings, give the computer a name and update the system to the latest version. Of course, you can also do this 8 times in a row or quasi-parallel - but since you need a screen and a keyboard, you would have to reconnect all the time. This way, an installation can be performed and then the SD card can be cloned.

For cloning I recommend the software Win32 Disk Imager, which can be downloaded and installed at the link below. In principle, this works exactly like the Pi Imager, but can also create images.

![win32diskimager](/images/win32diskimager.png)

https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

The operation of the software is very intuitive, so I'll skip a tutorial at this point. But before the SD card can be cloned, some software should be installed so that the individual Raspberry can be controlled headless after the cloning process - i.e. without using an external keyboard, monitor and mouse. 

## Installing additional software
After installing and configuring the basic system, I installed an OpenSSH server so that I can continue the rest of the installation steps from my PC. On the freshly installed system, open a console and install SSH through

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```

You will be asked for the password of the user you created in the installation process. The installation routine has automatically added this to the Sudoer group. This can be convenient, but it can also be a security risk. Decide for yourself whether you want to keep your user in this group. A system boot should not be necessary after installation, so you can connect directly to the Raspberry via ssh or Putty or any other software of your choice. After successfully logging in to the ubuntu system, you can now bring it up to date. Use these commands to do this:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Personally, I get along well with ssh as a command line, but sometimes it still makes sense to administrate via a graphical interface. To be able to do this, I have additionally installed xrdp on the Raspberry. To do this, execute these commands in the console:

```bash
sudo apt install xrdp
sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
sudo ufw allow 3389
sudo apt install xfce4
```

Now you have to edit the file /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh to change the desktop system from gnome to xfce4 which is absolutely sufficient and more performant through RDP sessions.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
```

Find these lines and comment them out with a "#"

```bash
test -x /etc/X11/Xsession && exec /etc/X11/Xsession 
exec /bin/sh /etc/X11/Xsession 
```

then add

```bash
startxfce
```

instead. Save the file, exit nano and restart the system by typing the command

```bash
sudo reboot now
```

If you are using windows, start you Remote Desktop Protocol and connect to your machine's IP. The user is the user you created during the installation process. The terminal may not start when you select it from the menu. This is usually because gnome-terminal is still entered as the default terminal. But this is not a big problem. Connect again via ssh and enter 

```bash
sudo update-alternatives â€“config x-terminal-emulator
```

at the console. Choose xfce and quit. Restart the rdp connection and you should be fine.

To be able to monitor the Raspberry, I still installed my health module. Please follow the instructions in this repository:

https://github.com/jegali/HealthPi

To make sure the GPIO pins will repond correctly when addressed, I installed the new LGPIO library:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-lgpio
```

If you want to install k3s on the nodes (and we want) you can find the command on the K3s website. Be sure to have curl installed!

```bash
sudo apt install curl
```

Ubuntu admitted they have a bug in the current release preventing the node to get active. Thankfully there is a package that can be installed. Please be patient, it will take some time to install, to backup and to reboot:

```bash
sudo apt install linux-modules-extra-raspi
sudo reboot
```


curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
# Check for Ready node,
takes maybe 30 seconds
k3s kubectl get node
```

## Changes to the firmware to make the hardware panel work
The really interesting problems always occur when you think you have everything installed. So I had connected my hardware panel to the Raspberry, but the LEDs did not light up. After a long research I then found out that by default under Ubuntu 21 the Serial Console is disabled - via this communicates GPIO pin 14 (TxD), and there is also the LED connected. The solution to the mystery: The line enable_uart=1 must be added to the file /boot/firmware/config.txt

```bash
[all]
kernel=vmlinuz
enable_uart=1
cmdline=cmdline.txt
initramfs initrd.img followkernel
```

Attention: In a Raspian installation you will find the config.txt file directly in the /boot directory. This directory and the file also exist under ubuntu - but you have to adjust the version under /boot/firmware!


## Customization on any device
This brings us to the end of the installation of Ubuntu. Now the SD card can be cloned and inserted into the other Raspberry. I recommend - to avoid confusion - to boot each Raspberry one after the other and to set the name on the command line:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname minion01 
```

Luckily, I did not had to set the IP settings in ubuntu but could use my fritzBox Interface, so this concludes the preparation for the cluster installation.


# Building of the Hardware Panel
As discussed earlier, I wanted to build a Hardware Panel to show the Raspberry's status and to be able to conveniently power on/off the devices. The following picture shows the panel in action.

![panel-1](/images/panel-1.png)

For the creation of the panel again some hardware was necessary. I needed an aluminum strip, some pushbuttons, LEDs, the necessary series resistors, cables and sockets for the LEDs.

In times of pandemic and closed stores, amazon is really a winner, so of course it's no surprise when I bought the components there. Aluminum strips are there in all colors and shapes, I chose a strip 40x20x1000mm, which still had to be cut to size afterwards

I bought light emitting diodes directly together with resistors, after I had calculated the required series resistance. This complete package left nothing to be desired

To be able to fit the LEDs well, I treated myself to some more sockets

I found the necessary buttons to switch on and off here

Of course, for tinkering you still need a soldering iron, ideally with a third hand and a little solder. But I see this rather as basic equipment and do not want to post more links here.

Using CorelDraw - a program I've been using for at least 30 years - I then drew and printed a layout of the switches and LEDs

![cluster-panel](/images/panel-2.png)

Fixed with scotch tape on the aluminum bar, the holes for the drilling could then be made with a center punch. Unfortunately, I didn't have much experience with machining aluminum, and using the metal drill available to me didn't produce the desired results.

![cluster-panel](/images/panel-3.jpg)

A visit to youTube Academy showed me that I should use a step drill. So ordered another step drill from Amazon and re-drilled the holes. And lo and behold - this time the holes were round and usable.

![cluster-panel](/images/panel-4.jpg)

The last time I soldered was about 30 years ago - accordingly, the first solder joint was also directly cold and broke. Here, too, a visit to the youTube Academy was worthwhile to refresh my rusty knowledge. After a few tentative attempts, soldering worked quite well again.

![cluster-panel](/images/panel-5.jpg)

And so it did not take long until the panel was completely soldered and assembled in front of me.

## Calculation of the resistor for the circuit

What I also didn't remember was the calculation of the series resistor for the LED circuit. So that I do not forget it this time again, I write down the procedure here.

The task is to make an LED light up on a Raspberry Pi. This is not very difficult. We need an LED (no matter what color), a resistor whose value still has to be calculated, a Raspberry Pi, preferably a plug-in board and connecting cables from the GPIO pins to the plug-in board.


In principle, you should never connect an LED directly between 3.3 V and GND. This can work well, but it does not have to. You have to know that LEDs have a fixed operating voltage, which is below 3.3 V and it also needs a current limiter, because otherwise they draw too much current, which causes them to self-destruct. Both the voltage and the current are controlled by a series resistor, the value of which depends on the excess voltage and the desired current through the light emitting diode.
It is also necessary to take into account that an LED has two different poles. So you have to pay attention to how around the LED is installed in the circuit.

In the following we will deal with how the LED is polarized and how the series resistor is calculated.

![cluster-panel](/images/circuit-panel-gpio.gif)

For the LED to light up, the GPIO "internal" must be switched to "high" (1). Only then a current flows through the LED.
To calculate the forward resistance we need two values. One value is the forward voltage U_F of the LED and the other value is the forward current I_F of the LED. Normally you can get these values from the datasheet of the LED.
If you don't have the data sheet of the LED or these values are unknown, then you have to find them out by experimenting.

We use an LED with 2.0 V and 20 mA (0.02 A) as an example. However, the 20 mA is the maximum value. This LED also lights up at 10 mA. Not quite as bright, but sufficiently visible. Therefore we take a value of 10 mA for the LED forward current.

![cluster-panel](/images/calculate-resistor.png)

The series resistance is calculated using Ohm's law. Here, a voltage is divided by the current, resulting in a resistor value. The voltage that must drop across the resistor is the total voltage (3.3 V) minus the LED forward voltage (2.0 V). The result (1.3 V) is divided by the LED forward current (10 mA) to get the value for the series resistor (130 Ohm).
Now, unfortunately, this value is not available as a component, so you have to take a slightly smaller or larger value. According to the E-series E12 the next smaller value is 120 Ohm. The next larger value is 150 Ohm. As a rule, one takes the larger value. I took a resistor value of 220 Ohm.

How to connect an LED correctly? Typically, the two connecting wires of an LED are of different lengths. The longer of the two is the anode (positive pole). The shorter one is the cathode (negative pole).
Easy to remember: The plus sign has one more dash than the minus sign, making the wire slightly longer. Also, most LEDs are flattened on the minus side, like a minus, or the "K" of the cathode.

With the circuit symbol, you can remember it like this. There, the circuit symbol has the shape of the letter "K" because of the crossbar. The triangle is similar to the letter "A". In the case of the crossbar, the terminal is the cathode and on the other side is the anode. The anode points away from the positive pole to the negative pole, indicating the direction of current. From plus to minus. And thus the anode is connected to the positive pole and the cathode to the negative pole.
