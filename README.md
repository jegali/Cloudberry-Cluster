# Cloudberry-Cluster
In this repository, I show how I built my raspberry Kubernetes cluster - including a small hardware project that deals with creating a front panel with LED and on/off switches so that the cluster can be conveniently started and shut down. The first part deals with the hardware requirements. The second part goes into with the creation of the panel. In part three I discuss the software installation on the 8 Raspberry Computers.<br/><br/>

## Hardware Requirements
I wanted to make the work for this project as pleasant as possible. In particular, I wanted to have a way to shut down the cluster for vacation periods and be able to restart it just as conveniently.
